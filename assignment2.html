                <h3>
                        What is the Layout for Each Page?
                    </h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        Each page has content answering the assignment brief questions. I wanted to use this information to create a blog style format, 
                        and add innovative titles which I did for the first part of assignment 1. 
                        The content covers a range of topics, from I.T. in business, functions of certain programmes for 
                        example Trello, and what pro’s and con’s of each softwareare. Topics about the blog itself were also 
                        covered, and discussion of how it could be improved too. The layout of eat page in fairly simple in design. 
                        I have included a main header which I created a free online platform called “Canva”. 
                        I wanted to try something new, the rest of the blog has a simple colour scheme and includes pictures. 
                        I also added in Gifs just to see if I could, the bulk of the writing is separated in headings and paragraphs. 
                        There are two pages, including an “About Me” section, and also jump links to navigate between the points easily.

                    <p>
                    Copyright according to google definition is the permission to reproduce photographs and other copyright material. 
                    Websites often face copyright issues, it seems like it is perfectly normal to copy content from other websites… All art is stolen at the end of the day right? But to answer the question, copying is not ok… unless you have the permission of the author.

                    <p>
                    Information does not need to have copyright notice or even a symbol that shows it is copyrighted, this is because copyright protection comes about when the author creates any original content. Contents of website are not any different than that of a magazine of book when it comes to copyright protection, although people tend to think of web content as more disposable. In 1998, A federal law was passed named the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), this makes it clear materials published on the Internet are protected by U.S. copyright laws.the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), makes it clear that materials published on the Internet are protected by U.S. copyright laws.
                    Other constraints may be psychological constraints;  this is how the user perceives their environment.

                    In an ideal universe, everyone should be able to have access to what they need. However the reality of the matter is that millions of people have impairments and disabilities that
                    make it difficult or even impossible to use certain websites.
                    Some main types of impairments are as follows hearing, motor skills, cognitive disibilities, vision, and photsenstive seizures. There are a number of ways you can make your website more user-friendly, it would be a good idea make sure your site is keybprd friendly, ensure all content is easily acsessable, and by adding alt text to all images.

                    <p>
                    Certain file types work better for creating websites, a few of them are CSS, JPEG, HTML, Microsoft Word, Photoshop files, 
                    Java Script, and PDF.
