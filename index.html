<h3 id ="Welcome">Writer: Zainab A</h3>
<h3 id ="Question1.1">What is the Purpose of A Modern Business?</h3>
<p> I.T. is a form of technology that has served us the great use of making our lives easier and better. 
    When there is a problem, IT is used to not only solve the problem but also make the whole problem a swifter endeavor to deal with. 
    Entrepreneurs and businesses find ways in which they can appeal to the consumer and sell to the mass market. 
    Experience technical assistants who can use certain technology devices to make these ideas come to life will be hired in in most cases to accomplish some of these goals.
    Technology allows these goals to become a reality. These days it is a huge challenge for businesses to have competitive edge without using technology.
    Some of the key ways technology is used in modern business are through productivity, by being able to use project and task management tools on a daily basis to stay on top of business responsibilities. 
    Another and more obvious one is Finance, I.T. can be used is for selling online to create an income stream for the business. 
    Also, using accounting software, sharing files for an improvement in booking operations. 
    Marketing is also a huge  part of promoting a business and in the modern era there is not a better way than using IT to get your business out there. 
    You can use it to use social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, and create your own website. Collecting emails and optimise the blessing and curse of email marketing. 
    Video marketing, blog making, and pinning on pinterest are all great ways to use as marketing tools from IT.</p>

 <h3 id="Question1.2">Digital Projects - How Can They Be Completed Sucsessfully?</h3>
 <p>  Digital Projects are conducted every day in the modern era of business and ecommerce. 
     In order to successfully complete a digital project there are a few things that need to be set in place. 
     It is useful to have an initial brainstorming session with team members or just yourself. 
     In order to get ideas out, once there are ideas on a page it then a good idea to set forth and create a plan. 
     In the plan it is important to discuss the requirements to get the idea off the ground, functionality, expenses, design, 
     and marketing development. Once planning is set, it is time for the development process. 
     Development includes creating the draft versions and a final product of the project. 
     Revisions and polishings are made to project, and then testing and development is employed into the procedures. 
     This element of creating a project is called Quality Management (QA) In the QA phase of the project you or your 
     team members conduct an analysis of the final project before it goes live. 
     Once the project is fully tested, it is now time to go live! Once the project is up off the ground and running, 
     we move on into meaning the project. Maintenance includes project support, addressing an issues that may come up, 
     and watching your project evolve. This is the general process of creating a digital project. 
     It is important to be organised, creative, and motivated when creating a project of any kind, 
     but specially for a project online it is vital for a comprehensive knowledge of how the online 
     world works and how to get tasks done regarding computers and technology. Some of the best tools you can 
     use are a PC, Laptop device, a phone, spreadsheets and powerpoints, social media, ecommerce platforms.</p>

<h3 id="Question1.3">Plan me - Plan, Plan, Trello!</h3>
<p> To make a website, I would create a step-by-step system implementing each step onto a Trello platform. 
    In order to work effectively, I will use Trello and Kanban for productivity. Trello will be most useful for inputting each step and crrating a to-do list for myself.  
    Kanban on the other hand, is great for project management tool.  
    It helps in effective visualisation work and making a proficient workflow system. 
    Kanban is also excellent for giving feedback and other members of the team will be able to participate in that. 
    By implementing these components in the project, I think it makes for a very agile procedure.

<h3 id="Question1.4">Digital Projects - What makes them Fail?</h3>
<p> Sometimes things fail, and digital project often do. 
    “Somewhere between 70% and 90% of digital projects fail.... Couchbase found that 90% of projects failed to deliver as promised, 
    failed to deliver beyond minor improvements, or completely flopped. That’s a wide failure range.”
    Projects tend to fail for a number of reasons, the Harvard Business Review states “With innovative 
    information technology, however, executives sometimes lose their rational decision approaches. 
    Certainly it’s true that in times of radical technological change there’s a lot of figuring out to do.” 
    One of the main reasons that a project may fail is failing to account for the business process… 
    One of the main reasons a project can go under are in the initial development phase; poor project definition and 
    expectation setting in the beginning stages can affect the project overall. 
    Like a domino effect. I fell victim to this in my first digital venture when creating an app at code nation. 
    Setting way to high of an expectation in  a short period of time, admittingly setting a standard within time frame would be advisable. 
    Digital Projects are often too ambitious in the initial stages, Enginees suggests in creating a time frame extension by 20-30% for all projects. 
    Another reason is investing in gadests and “shiny things” and not so much in customer service. 
    “For instance, say a CEO asks a digital project manager to deploy a CRM. The CEO just read an article that said CRMs are the future, 
    and she wants one.”...  The project brief here is not necessarily valuing the customer’s needs. In the future this will cause further issues down the line. 
    It is better to develop an idea that considers the customers values, and not just going about a task due to the CEO’s say so. 
    This is a major reason why projects of the digital means fail.</p>

<h3 id="Question1.5">What's The Right Technology To Use? - Digital Projects</h3>
<p>When determining what IT systems to use for a particular task, there are a few ways to go about it. An easy method is to first make a note of what the particular job 
    is an what tasks it entails. For example if you creating an application, then it would be necessary to include software programs such as Slack and Trello to 
    communicate and organise tasks within the company. The means of creating the application itself will need to be chosen, software programs such as Xcode 
    are a great means for creating content for applications as it is a free tool and easy to use. In order to pick the right tools common knowledge is helpful, 
    if you do not have any prior knowledge to what kinds of software programmes are available to you for that specific task then it would be necessary to find reviews online and do some 
    research before starting the project at hand. Before purchasing a product, it is good to have a look at each tool in depth and then decide what fits best in your needs.</p>

<h3 id="Question1.6">Technologies? Which is Best to Use For Me?</h3>
<p>Chosen technologies such as Trello, git, and GitHub can be extremely useful. 
    Trello is great for building project related boards to share with teams members. 
    By creating boards with lists, the project is cut down into bite size pieces and easier to manage. 
    Git and GitHub are extremely important components in creating efficient and effective contribute code, 
    “99% of the companies that can hire you will use Git and GitHub”. 
    With Git, whenever a new component of code is entered, unlike Microsoft word, 
    git will automatically remember the changes ,ade to the code and update the programme itself. 
    Even if thousands of changes have been made each change is remembered by Git concisely and effectively. 
    Once more, if you are in need of reverting back to make some changes that you did even 5 months ago, 
    Git allows you to do so with ease and precision. It also allows your programmer to make branches of 
    code revert changes and merge conflicts etc. These are extremely helpful when it comes to solving a problem in software 
    on a day to day at the office. Git is most likely describes as the main solution in the computing world these days. GitHub however 
    is viewed more an an extra layer used on top of Git, that gives solutions to common problems found in reviews and bugs found in 
    management, pull requests and so on.</p>
